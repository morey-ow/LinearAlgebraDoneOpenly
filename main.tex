\chapter{Solutions to Select Exercises}\label{apx:solutions}

%\textbf{Disclaimer}: Every assigned exercise should contain a solution 
%which is clearly and neatly presented, 
%has completely and thoroughly answered the question asked, 
%followed the directions provided, 
%and contains enough explanation so that one of your classmates would be able to easily understand how you arrived at your conclusion. 
%Additionally, solutions should be clearly labeled and in order. 
%The style of your written solutions should be very much like that of a text book example. 
%Generally, it is inadequate to merely write down a final answer. \\
%
%It is not academic dishonesty to own or read the student solution manual 
%or to use any other tutoring reference, like Chegg.com. 
%However, directly copying or rewriting in your own words a solution 
%from one of these manuals, 
%from a peer's assignment, 
%or another source onto your homework 
%is plagiarism and a form of academic dishonesty. 
%This is especially true for proof writing. 
%You are supposed to struggle with writing proofs. 
%Struggling with a difficult concept is how our brains rewire itself for higher conceptualization. 
%Reading a completed proof and rewording it will not be tolerated. 
%Any student caught committing this form of academic dishonesty will receive a zero score on ALL homework assignments.\\
%
%On the other hand, discussion of homework assignments is allowed and strongly encouraged, 
%but you should keep in mind that doing your homework is an individual responsibility. 
%Everything you turn in should be in your own words 
%and you should thoroughly understand everything you write down. 
%These principles of academic integrity apply to all assignments, not just homework.\\
